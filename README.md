# JaviScript Language

Now yes, the **DEFINITIVE** version of my OWN programming language is here (work in progress), with some changes in the syntax and more functions!

## Syntax
They're 2 types of commands in the language, the `Built-In commands` and the `Functions`.
- `Built-In commands`: These commands are written, the **command itself**, and **space** and the **parameters** splited by **commas**.\
  Syntax: `<command> <parm1>, <parm2>` or `<command> <parm1>,<parm2>`.
- `Functions`: These are the functions of the language, you can use the integrated ones or a custom one. They are written, the **function name**, **parenthesis** and the parameters inside splited by **commas**.\
  Syntax: `<function>(<parm1>, <parm2>)`.
